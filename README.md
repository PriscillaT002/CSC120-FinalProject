 When starting this project we knew that we wanted to follow the guidlines for the text-based game option. It was honestly amazing how fast we all agreed on a game idea! After deciding to create a haunted house exploration game we kinda got ahead of ourselves and started planning to incorporate ideas that we didn't know at the time would be a bit too complex to finish in the amount of time we were given. Over the course of the project we decided to simplify our game and make it way more straight forward. 

 We learned how to implement images into our game! This was just an idea that we thought would be cool but after some thinking we decided to actually try and use at least one image (The inital image that pops up during the beginning of the game). It was a bit confusing to figure out at first but after some googling and test running we got a seperate pop-up window to show up with the picture of our haunted house from our images folder.

 I think we could've made the objects class and rooms class one file but having them seperately made things easier to code. I was worried we were going to override eachother's code but surprisingly this wasn't a huge problem. I give props to the work log we kept track of, as it allowed us to see when & who was working on what in real-time.

 If we had more time I think we for sure would add more images and format their appearance to look better. I think we would even add more players, room objects, and a life meter for the situation where a player might get possessed by a ghost.

 I think that a lot of the students that I spoke to gave good feedback on our logical errors. Talking to other groups gave us good insight on how a gameloop should progress and made working through our code and house layout a lot easier.

 If I could go back in time I would tell myself to look at our past assignments more and ask more questions during office hours. I felt as If I was bugging too much but at the end of the day its better to ask more questions rather than stay confused and drag the team behind. 

 My team got along really well. We all understood our strengths and assigned tasks based on availability and interests. I think for the most part we were always on the same page and it was fun getting to hear everyone's idea for the project. Having an organized work log and weekly meetings really helped our team maintain it's structure. I would love to work with this team again in the future if we ever needed to.
